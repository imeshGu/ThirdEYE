Main Objective:   
//Implement a web application to detect and recognize crimes before or while happening and inform details about them to law enforcement officials to 
prevent them by taking necessary actions

Main Research questions
//The number of crimes in the world is increasing day by day.  No matter how much the security forces try, they have not been able to control it or reduce the amount of crime.  This is a serious threat to the safety of the entire public. 
 It is an unfortunate fact that technology has not been actively used to maintain peace in the society, no matter how advanced the technology is.  It has been proven that trying to fight crime using only human labor for many years is futile.  The time has come
 to use technology for that.  If a crime can be identified with the help of technology before it occurs and the relevant security agencies can be informed and prevented, it is a better situation. 
 

Individual research question
//question 1 - Identification of missing persons and criminals is often done through police checkpoints. Apart from that, if the route they traveled is known, the CCTV data along that route will be checked. This is a very tedious task. Also, its accuracy is very low. It is faulty. With the ongoing covid epidemic, many people are wearing face masks.
Then it is very difficult to identify them. A mechanism has not yet been developed to identify them immediately before any crime or life-threatening incident.

//question 2 -   A person shows a specific pattern of behavior in preparation for committing a crime.  It is suspicious behavior.  It is often difficult for the busy human eye to grasp.  Even for a police officer in a densely populated area, it is difficult to identify the behavior of a criminal. Also, there are difficulties in monitoring the suspicious
behavior of a person with CCTV cameras at night.  If these suspicious behaviors of a person can be detected early, crime prevention can be quite easy. 

//question 3 - Subtle changes in facial expressions are seen when a person is about to commit a crime.  These are difficult to observe for a normal human eye. A person's inner thoughts and intentions
are often expressed through the face in such cases.  No mechanism has yet been developed to detect such things for the overall safety of the society. 

//question 4 -  Weapons are often used to commit a crime.  Guns, poles, iron pipes, knives, ropes etc. are often used for this purpose.  If a person comes into a crowded place 
with such a weapon, the probability that it will be observed by the average human eye is quite low.  Because most of the time they carry these weapons concealed in some way.
Then it is very difficult to identify. These are difficult to detect in advance unless a person is thoroughly screened by a police officer.
